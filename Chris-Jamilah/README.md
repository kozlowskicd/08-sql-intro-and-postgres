# Lab 08 - SQL Intro and Postgres 

**Author**: Chris and Jamila
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
A database is used to store the articles, rather than an external file.  The data is pulled from the database to build the articles and queries are included to create, update, and delete them.

## Getting Started
Ensure 'express' and 'pg' are correctly installed through npm and run server.js with node/nodemon.

## Architecture
We are using postgres to create a database to store the articles table.  Express and jQuery's AJAX methods are used for network communications.
